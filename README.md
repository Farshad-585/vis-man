# Visitor Management System

---
## Project Overview

The Uniersity of Western Australia has several physical sites outside of the Crawley campus that allow visitor access. Currently, there is no robust system to keep track of visitors, which presents potential security and health & safety issues.

The goal of this project is to supply a robust tracking system that logs visitor movements, such that those in charge can keep track of who is present at a site, increase accountability for those using the sites, and present site usage data to management for data analysis purposes. 

A demo version of the website is avaiable at https://uwavms.herokuapp.com/. To access the admin site use the following credentials:
 - username: admin
 - password: admin
