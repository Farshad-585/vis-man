Draft Application Layout/Structure

One website for all the sites. Sites will be differentiated through different url paths.
There is a sign in and sign out paths, and sites with accomodation facilities will have 
additional pages asking for details relating to that. It will have some similarities 
to the example given by Chris. Here are the details for each page (the exact url names 
are yet to be decided): 

1. /uwa_visitor_management.com/

This homepage page will ask users which site they are visiting. Users will select the 
correct option for a list of all the sites. 
- Gingin Gravity precinct
- UWA Farm Ridgefield
- The Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis
- Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre Crawley
- Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre Watermans Bay
- Animal Care Services
- Coastal and Offshure Engineering Lab

When the user has selected their site, they can move to the next page pertaining to 
that site, and choose to sign in or sign out.

Alternatively, each sites link and QR code could take them to that particular sites 
homepage instead of the general homepage, e.g. /uwa_visitor_management.com/gingin_gravity/. 

2. /uwa_visitor_management.com/gingin_gravity/

The user will choose to sign in or sign out. The next page they can move to depends on 
which option they chose. 

3. /uwa_visitor_management.com/gingin_gravity/sign_in/

If the user chose sign in on the last page, then they will be taken here and asked to 
fill in their visitor details, which are;
- Full name
- Role
  - UWA staff
  - UWA student
  - other University staff
  - other university student
  - contractor 
  - other
- Email adrress
- Mobile phone number

If the site doesn't have accomodation facilities, then the user can submit their answers
and move on to the confirmation page. 

If the site happens to be one with accomodation facilities, then there will be an
additional question:
- Will you be staying over night? (Yes, No)

If the user selects no, then they will be able to submit their answers and move on to
the confirmation page. If the user selects yes, then they can move on to the next page 
where they will answer accomodation details and read some house rules. 

4. /uwa_visitor_management.com/gingin_gravity/sign_in/accommodation/

The user will answer questions relating to their stay and read some house rules.
- A list of house rules to respect, which are:
  - behave in a mature and considerate manner at all times
  - clean up after yourself and share cleaning duties with other house members
  - keep noise to a minimum and be mindful of people studying or sleeping
  - drunken behaviour, drugs and other illicit substances are strictly prohibited
  - the gingin gravity precinct is a smoke free zone
  - no pets allowed
  - respect all UWA property and the surrounding environment
  - report any faults, damage or concerns to John Moore, Operations Manager
- Arrival date (dd/MM/yyyy)
- Departure date (dd/MM/yyyy)
- Have you completed the Gingin Gravity Precinct Building Induction? (Yes, No, other)

After filling out these questions, the user can move on to the next page and answer
questions about their emergency contact information. 

5. /uwa_visitor_management.com/gingin_gravity/sign_in/emergency_contact/

The user will answer questions about their emergency contact details:
- Full name of emergency contact person
- Emergency contact phone number
- Relationship to you

Once these questions have been completed, the user can submit their answers and they 
will be taken to the confirmation page. 

6. /uwa_visitor_management.com/gingin_gravity/sign_in/confirmation/

The confirmation page displays a simple thank you message and gives the users some 
options for what to do next:
- Option to print or get PDF of answers
- Option to sign out

7. /uwa_visitor_management.com/gingin_gravity/sign_out

If the user chose the sign out option instead of the sign in option on this sites 
homepage, then they will be taken here. All the user has to do is provide the minimum 
amount of information necessary to identify them. This is something we need to decide. 
Assuming this was just someones name and mobile phone number, the page would look like 
this:
- Full name
- Mobile phone number

When the user has answered these questions, they can submit and be taken the sign out 
confirmation page. It is then up to the website to match the name and phone number to a person in the 
database and mark them as having left. 

8. /uwa_visitor_management.com/gingin_gravity/sign_out/confirmation

This page is almost the same as the sign in confirmation page, except the thank you 
message is different. 
- Option to print or get PDF of answers
- Option to sign in again
