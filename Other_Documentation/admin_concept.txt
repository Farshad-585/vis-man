Draft Application Layout/Structure

The following is a draft of the layout of the special admin application. This website 
requires a username and password to log-in. The username should be displayed in the top 
right or left corner of every page. 

1. vis_man_admin/login/

This is a simple login page. The admin enters a username and password in a text box 
provided and clicks submit. If username exists and the password is correct, they will be 
taken to the next page. Incorrect password resets the text box and prints an 'incorrect 
password' message to the screen. Incorrect username does a similar thing. 

2. vis_man_admin/home/

This is basically the websites hub page. Here there will be an option to change password, 
and create new accounts. There will be an option to log out. There is no logout page, once 
logged out the user will simply be taken back to the login page. There will also be the 
option to go to three different pages: 
- a page where visitor details can be searched and edited
- a page where the vurrent visitors for each site can be searched and edited
- a page where the visit history can be searched and edited

3. vis_man_admin/change_pword/

If user selects change password in the home page, they will be taken to this page. 
Here there is a text box asking them to enter the current password and another two asking 
them to enter the new pass twice. Once submitted, if the current password entered correctly 
and the two new passwords match, then it will change the password and take them back to 
the homepage. If current password is entered wrongly or two new passwords entered 
differently, then appropriate error messages will be shown and the text boxes will reset. 

4. vis_man_admin/new_user/

If the user selected 'create new user' on the home page then this is where they come. 
They will be asked to enter the details of the new user and if the username matches an 
existing username, then it will not be allowed and an appropriate error message will be 
shown. If done validly, will be taken back to homepage. 

5. vis_man_admin/visitors/

This page can be accessed from the homepage. It allows the user to search up past/current 
visitors by name and look at their stored details. It also allows the user to edit the 
fields for any visitor. This essentially allows them to query and edit the Visitors table.
Also an option to back to home page.  

6. vis_man_admin/current/

This page can be accessed from the homepage. It allows the user to query and edit the 
'current visitors' table, too see who is currently signed in to any of the 7 sites. It also 
allows the user to edit this table by removing visitors from the table, if they forgot to 
log out. Also an option to go back to homepage. 

7. vis_man_admin/all_visits/

This page can be accessed from the homepage. It allows the user to query and edit the 
'history' table. All visits are recorded in this table once a visitor signs out of a 
particular site. Also an option to go back to homepage.
