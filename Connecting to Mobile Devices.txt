**Steps have been tested on Windows 10. (Not on VM or WSL). And Android phone.
1> Find IPaddr of your machine on windows this can be done by typing 'ipconfig'.
2> Record you IPv4 addr - > 
	IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.10.102. 
	Note that is the IPv4 for my Wireless LAN adapter.
3> Now under Django project - open settigs.py and add your machine IP to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
	eg. ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['192.168.10.102']
4> Start Django server with 
	python manage.py runserver 192.168.10.102:7000
	So here it is runserver MACHINE_IP:PORT
	Port can be 8000, 7000 etc.
5> On mobile phone enter MACHINE_IP:PORT
	eg 192.168.10.102:7000
